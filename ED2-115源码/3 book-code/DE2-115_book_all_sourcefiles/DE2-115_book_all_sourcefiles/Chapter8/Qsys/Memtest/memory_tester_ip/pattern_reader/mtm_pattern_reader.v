Custom pattern read master core

Author:  JCJB
Date:    04/07/2010

Description:  This block is responsible for posting bursting or non-bursting read
              transactions to the fabric.  The data byte lanes are reversed and
              sent to the streaming source port.
              
              A word aligned address and length that is a multiple of the word size
              is passed to the core and it immediately begins reading from memory.
              A programmable bit to signal when the transfer completion should occur
              is also available.  When early done is enabled the core will reach
              completion when the last read has been posted.  Otherwise completion
              occur when the last read data returns from the fabric.  To hide transfer
              overhead it is recommended to enable early done for all but the last
              command.
              
              Reduce the transfer length width to increase the Fmax of the logic.
              When connecting the read master to burst wrapping slaves (SDRAM) enable
              BURST_ALIGNED_ENABLE.  This will ensure the master never crosses a
              burst boundary in the middle of a burst transaction.  The master has an
              overhead of one cycle after a transfer command is accepted and it will
              become ready for another command the cycle after the last read/read data
              returns.
              
              The command format is as follows:
              
              Bits 63:0 -->   Read base address
              Bits 95:64 -->  Read buffer length
              Bit  96 -->     Read early done
