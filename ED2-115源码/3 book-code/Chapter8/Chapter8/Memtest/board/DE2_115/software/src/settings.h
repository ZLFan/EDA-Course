/*  When porting to other boards and memories you should be able to re-use the same design and just swap out the memory controller under test.
    The following settings should be changed to match the memory you are testing:

    NUM_OF_TESTS --> Each test loop can take over a minute so set this value for the number of times to repeat the test, use -1 to test indefinitely
    DATA_WIDTH   --> Set this to be the width of the memory test controllers (and the memory) in terms of bytes
    RAM_BASE     --> Set this to be the base address of the memory under test
    RAM_SPAN     --> Set this to be the span of your memory in bytes

    All the other settings can most likely be left alone, they are only provided for completeness.
